# International Address Database (iadb)

## Demo

***Serverless Demo***: [Address Picker (zebraelectronics-cloud.github.io)](https://zebraelectronics-cloud.github.io/iadb/) - This demonstration proves that address data could be directly loaded from GitHub **(without using a database)** using the ServerlessAddressApi class, which can be utilized on any website without the need to host gigabytes of address data.

***Hosted Demo***: [Adres Picker (iadb.fast-page.org)](https://iadb.fast-page.org/static/examples/address-picker/index.html) - This demonstration proves that address data could be served via any web server without hosting the address content in a database and proves that the server response time could be drastically reduced using server-level caching. (See the server code here: [server/php](https://github.com/zebraelectronics-cloud/iadb/tree/main/server/php). Contributions for ported versions are welcome!)
